# Simple Weather CLI
Description: This mini project involves building a simple command-line interface (CLI) application in Rust that fetches weather data from a public API, parses the JSON response, and displays the weather information in a user-friendly format.

Requirements:

Rust installed on your computer (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
A text editor or IDE for Rust (e.g., Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension)
An API key for OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/appid)
